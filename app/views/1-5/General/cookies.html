            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why our use of your personal data is lawful</h2>
            <p>In order for our use of your personal data to be lawful, we need to meet one (or more) conditions in the
                data protection legislation. For the purpose of this service the processing is necessary for the
                performance of a task carried out in the public interest. In this case it is necessary for the
                department to process your data to assess your eligibility for managing T Levels.</p>

            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Who we will make your personal data available to</h2>
            <p>We sometimes need to make personal data available to other organisations. These might include contracted
                partners (who we have employed to process your personal data on our behalf) and/or other organisations
                (with whom we need to share your personal data for specific purposes).</p>
            <p>Where we need to share your personal data with others, we ensure that this data sharing complies with
                data protection legislation. We share the names of contract signatories and users who have reviewed
                contract documents with other members of your organisation who are also users of the service.</p>

        <section class="text">
            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How long we will keep your personal data</h2>
            <p>We will only keep your personal data for as long as we need it for the purpose(s) of this service, after
                which point it will be securely destroyed. This will usually be 7 years after the end of each contract.
            </p>
            <p>If you haven’t signed in for 366 days, we’ll delete your account and remove your personal details. You’ll
                need to register again to use the service.</p>
            <p>Please note that, under Data Protection Legislation and in compliance with the relevant data processing
